What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden folder by the name of .git is created. It contains all the information required for tracking the commits done on that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
We can slectively add files that we want to commit into the staging area. It acts a placeholder for the files that we want to commit.
