How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

We could compare the two files line by line and see the difference.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

We can see the state of the file at different stages.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Might forget to commit while auto commit has too many commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git takes a snapshot of all files at each commit. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can always revert the changes that broke the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A sample project for testing all git features.
